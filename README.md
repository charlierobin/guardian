# Guardian Meme Generator
The site that used to be found at guardianmeme.com, before the humourless jackasses at The Guardian had it taken down via takedown notice.

Lest this parody gem be lost to history (unlikely, but you never know) I downloaded the source files from the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200723185948/https://www.guardianmeme.com/), cleaned it all up a little, and fixed all the internal links so that there are no external dependencies.

You should just be able to download, and doubleclick index.html to launch in your desktop browser.

Regrettably, the Internet Archive Wayback Machine only captured a handful of pundit headshots (24 to be exact). Trying to use the others just raises a not found error.

When I get a moment, I might go over to The Guardian website and see if the others can be retrieved and added. It seems such a shame to not be able to avail ourselves of all the massive talent that newspaper can supply.
